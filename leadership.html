						<p class="name">Matthew Ro</p>
						<p class="description">After completing his Master of Divinity from Biblical Theological Seminary in May 2002 and serving five years in the Greater Philadelphia area as a youth pastor and associate pastor, &ldquo;P. Matt&rdquo; felt a call from the Lord in 2003 to plant a campus church in Atlanta.  With an initial team of six members, The Journey Church of Atlanta was launched in August 2004. What initially began as an exclusively campus church, Journey has now grown into a multi-site, multi-generational, multi-cultural ministry with a commitment to church-planting, disciple-making, and reaching the lost for Christ.</p>
						<p>P. Matt's personal mission statement is to see hope restored in people's lives through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  His main ministry responsibilities include: pioneering, staff/leadership development, teaching, counseling, and leading with vision.  He enjoys reading, spending time with his family, and following his beloved Michigan State football and basketball teams.  P. Matt and his wife, Julia, were married in May 2006 and are the proud parents of two daughters, Ella and Audrey. </p>

						<p class="position">Singles Pastor</p>
						<p class="name">David Moon</p>
						<p class="description">David and his wife, Grace, came to Journey in 2015 after living in Boston for several years as students at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.  It was while David was studying to go into law enforcement that God called him into full-time ministry.  This was a difficult calling for David to accept in the initial years, until the grace of God became more clear to him, changing everything.  That is the passion of his heart for ministry, to help others see the beauty of grace and allow it to change everything in their lives.</p>

						<p>Grace hails from Yeongju, South Korea (where?!), and David grew up in the great city of Dallas (I root for all Dallas teams). They have two sons, Daniel and Noah.</p>

						<p class="name">Min Soo Choi</p>
						<p class="description">Min Soo graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign having studied Business Administration and is currently pursuing a M.Div at Reformed Theological Seminary.  Min Soo entered seminary because of his heart for overseas missions, but during his time at Urbana, he became passionate about local college campus ministry.  Through building relationships with college students, he aims to produce disciples of Christ who simply love God’s Word and God’s people.</p>

						<p>Min Soo joined the Journey family in January 2015, and in May 2016, he married the love of his life, Ah Rim, who also has a heart for missions and desires to see the making of disciples from all nations.</p>

						<p class="name">Ben Ahn</p>
						<p class="description">Ben was born and raised in Nashville, TN.  He started attending Journey in 2009 when he began college at Emory University.  As Ben started to get more involved at church and deepened his faith, he grew in maturity and leadership, ultimately receiving a call into pastoral ministry.</p>

						<p>In the fall of 2015, Ben started seminary and can joyfully say that he is still searching for what God has in store.  He loves missions because it is his act of worship and the only way that the lost can hear the Gospel. </p>

						<p class="name">Claudia Robbie</p>
						<p class="description">Claudia is a native New Yorker who transplanted to Atlanta to pursue a degree in engineering.  After many bumps and turns, she gave her life to the Lord at age 19 and decided to forego her parents’ dream of becoming an engineer and instead, pursued Business Administration.  In 2007, Claudia found her way to Journey and has been committed ever since.</p>

						<p>Claudia is passionate about organizing, networking and relationships.  Through the healing of brokenness in her life, God also cultivated a passion for deep discipleship among sisters and a desire for each woman to grow into their God-given calling to affect and change the world.  Claudia is married to Trevor (Aug 2003) and they have two children, Isabelle and Owen</p>

It was in this church that he met his wonderful wife and best friend, Jennifer.  They have three kids together: Timothy, Abigail and Olivia.</p>

						<p>In 2010, he and his family left to Colombia for four years to serve as full-time missionaries to different native tribes.  There, Dandy trained locals to become pastors to their own indigenous community.  After returning from Colombia, the Lord led Dandy and his family to join the Journey Church of Atlanta family in July 2016 and serve as Family Pastor.</p>

						<p>Amy currently works as an analyst at CarMax and is pursuing an MBA at Georgia Tech.  Her passions include hosting meals to bring people together, applying business principles to church ministry, supporting long-term overseas missionaries, and encouraging others through prayer.
